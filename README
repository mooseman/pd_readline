 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

  This repo is for the storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation. 

Update - 6th Sep 2012 - 

Almost there!  
The code now pretty much works as expected. 

It looks like the stack-smash problem has now 
been fixed. I've give the code a pretty good 
hammering and it didn't give me problems. 

Pressing Enter still exits the program rather 
than storing the existing command-line and "staying 
in the program". I hope to change this soon.     

You can edit a command-line (using backspace). 
You can move around with left and right-arrow 
keys. 
Command-history can be recalled from a file with 
the up-arrow key, and you can scroll up and down 
through the command-history. 

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy........ ;)  "
