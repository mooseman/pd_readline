 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

  This repo is for the (eventual) storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation. 

Update - 26th Aug 2012 - 

Very useful progress.  
Keystroke sequences are now stored in an array of structs. 
This makes it VERY easy to see the various special flags 
in a keystroke sequence 
(e.g. Esc, Ctrl, Alt and so on..... ).  

Still some way to go to get to a REAL readline, but we are 
"on the way......"

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy........ ;)  "
