 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

  This repo is for the storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation. 

Update - 5th Sep 2012 - 

Almost there!  
The code now "pretty much" works as expected. 
( However, pressing Enter exits the program rather 
than storing the existing command-line and "staying 
in the program". I hope to fix this soon. )   

You can edit a command-line (using backspace). 
You can move around with left and right-arrow 
keys. 
Command-history can be recalled from a file with 
the up-arrow key, and you can scroll up and down 
through the command-history. 

*** CAUTION! *** - There is, however, an occasional 
problem with "stack-smashing". 


This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy........ ;)  "
