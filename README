 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

  This repo is for the (eventual) storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation. 

Update - 24th Aug 2012 - 
Added the mg editor files from OpenBSD. 
I obtained the code from here - 
ftp://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/OpenBSD/src/usr.bin/mg/

( It's not so much the editor itself that is the main interest here, 
but the line-management code. )  

NOTE - in the mg directory, the file "theo.c" is NOT 
"public domain" ( but it HAD to be included because of the 
humour......  ;)    )  

Many thanks to the OpenBSD team and the mg devs 
(hi Theo - arrrrrrgh, please don't hit me........... ;)     )
