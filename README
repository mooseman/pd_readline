 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

 This repo is for the storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation.  

FILES:  

pd_readline.c  -  This is a file to test the 
implementation. Contains the main() function. 

test.txt -  A small text file to test scrolling 
up and down with. This would be the "history" file 
in a real readline implementation.  


Status - 31st Dec 2015 - "sort of works".  

I'm back into doing work on this code. 

I've reverted the code to a much simpler early version. 
This compiles without errors and allows scrolling up 
and down through the "test.txt" "dummy history" file. 
It also allows editing of the command line. 
However, edits are *not* yet saved in a history file.   

Pressing Enter exits the program rather than storing 
the existing command-line and "staying in the program". 
I hope to change this soon.     

You can edit a command-line (using backspace). 
You can move around with left and right-arrow 
keys. 
"Dummy" history (from text.txt) can be recalled from a file with 
the up-arrow key, and you can scroll up and down 
through that file using the up and down arrows. 

This code is released to the public domain.
