 ***** README - pd_readline ***** 

  This repo is for the (eventual) storage of a public-domain  
readline-and-command-history implementation. 

Update - 26th Aug 2012 - 

Very useful progress.  
Keystroke sequences are now stored in an array of structs. 
This makes it VERY easy to see the various special flags 
in a keystroke sequence 
(e.g. Esc, Ctrl, Alt and so on..... ).  

Big breakthrough - the code can now distinguish between 
normal "printable" keys and keys that should not be 
printed (e.g. arrow keys, Ctrl sequences and so on).  

The next goal is to make the code move the cursor to the 
left (when left-arrow is pressed) and delete a char (when 
backspace is pressed). 

Still some way to go to get to a REAL readline, but we are 
"on the way......"

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy........ ;)  "
